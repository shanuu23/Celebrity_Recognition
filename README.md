# Celebrity_Recognition

This project focuses on the classification of celebrities using machine learning models. The objective is to identify and recognize celebrities from images based on facial features.

Models Tested and Their Performance
Several traditional machine learning models were evaluated for this task:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): 62% accuracy

Logistic Regression: 61% accuracy

Random Forest: 30% accuracy

While SVM and Logistic Regression showed moderate performance, Random Forest underperformed significantly on this dataset, likely due to the high-dimensional nature of facial image data.

# Future Work
In the next phase of this project, I plan to implement deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are better suited for image classification tasks. This approach is expected to significantly improve accuracy and overall recognition performance.
